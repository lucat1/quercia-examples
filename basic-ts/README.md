# quercia-basic-ts

> This example extends the `basic` skeleton and adds typescript support.

This is a basic example of a `quercia` application. You should now install the
npm dependencies with your favorite package manager, and later run one of these
scripts:

- `dev` - runs the quercia compiler in watch mode and builds a development
  application

- `build` - builds the application for production mode and optimizes code

- `mock` - runs the mocking server and serves the aforementioned application

## workflow

The ideal workflow for development is running `dev` in one terminal to build the
application and hot-reload on changes, while mocking example server responses
with the `mock` command(defined in the `mocks` folder).
